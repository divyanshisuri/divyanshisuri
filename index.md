5.1-5.6 Study Notes

5.1 Video Notes: Beneficial and Harmful Effects

WII and iPhone
WII before iPhone
Both have accelerometers, in development for same periods of time
Accelerometer part of automotive industry → airbags when too fast; prevents injury
Quadcopter: brain w a sense, accelerometer
Ppl complete tasks by changing things through innovation
Miltirotor
Benefits: deliveries, finding ppl, easy photography
Harmful: flying in unreg. zones, illegal/dangerous, privacy concerns
WII
Controller: gets ppl active
Harmful: broken tv’s, injuries
Not every effect of innovation anticipated
Effects of comp innovation are dangerous/beneficial at the same time, to many ppl or same person even
Ppl create computing innovations (3d printers)
Advances in computing generated creativity in other fields
LOOK AT FLOWCHARTS! Assume anything will work unless stated otherwise
Beneficial and Harmful Effects.2

Comp innovation can impact beyond purpose
Ex: internet was beneficial, now ppl spend more time on internet than sleep
Dopamine feedback loops → like, comment, etc: happier
Leads to sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity
Tiktok PSA lol! Computing innovations used in ways that are unintended; programmers try to consider these ways and potential benefits/harms Microtransactions
Little payments for cosmetics, paywall to functionality, sometimes pay to win, etc.
Comp innovations may harm society, economy, culture
Impossible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation is used
Rapid sharing of a program results in impacts beyond intended purpose/control
5.2 Video Notes: Digital Divide

Issues that contribute to divide
Internet access varies bw all areas
Divide → differing access
Socioeconomic: how much money comes into house each yr
Geographic: live w not that many ppl; no Internet
Demographics (Age, Religion) → less likely to have these things
Countries: computers not common in rural areas, small # of websites, internet to protect/advocate govt, high surveillance to protect govt.
Digital divide affects grps, individuals, raises issues, affected by actions of orgs, individuals, etc.

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:

Beneficial

i. Beneficial effects of computing include enhanced tech advances that can aid us in our educational experiences, by being able to use services such as IntelliJ and the internet when necessary.

ii. We can create websites or other online platforms that help students or even adults around the world.

iii. Tech is also a great time-saver. It definitely helps with efficiency as we’re can definitely use it in our daily activities, instead of doing things in an older way.

Disadvantageous

i. Tech can be harmful because of social media. We often look online and see others and admire their lives that it lowers self-esteem and can bring a variety of mental health problems.

ii. Tech can bring a sense of isolation. We no longer pick up calls, we only text. Studies have found proof of this, that individuals that use social media much more actively than those who don’t, have a higher sense of self-isolation.

iii. Tech can be harmful because of time, also. It can be pretty distracting and often takes time for me to get back on track, to stop procrastinating.

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Dopamine is definitely real. It is not a parent conspiracy, as it has been scientifically proven. While we don’t notice it, we do feel it and it gives us an enhanced sense of joy, which is fabricated. It can be really hard to ignore and attaches us to our devices more, which thus worsens mental health. It’s like an endless cycle. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

i. By using any device (s) of any kind, someone is empowered. Now they have responsibility and power and can either use their power to inflict harm or spread positivity. We often see wrondoing, when there are instances of cyberbullying, sexting, etc. Through these tiny devices, we have an immense amount of power that goes both unnoticed and is a huge disadvantage to both rural or underprivileged areas which do not have access or financial ability to gain access, and is used incorrectly for people who want to take advantage of others, or use these devices to do awful things. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

ii. We can often help others by sharing our devices or possibly financing certain products that someone we care about is unable to access.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

iii. Yes! Definitely. There are a lot of set rules that make it difficult for there to be fair allocation of devices, and so not everybody is empowered. At DNHS, there are many students who cannot get a device of their own, and must use a chromebook in school everyday provided by the school. This exists all over the world, in underprivileged and rural areas, and strong adhesion to such rules.
